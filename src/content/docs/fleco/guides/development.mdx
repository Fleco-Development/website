title: Development Setup
---

:::note
Fleco is currently in Development, all of this is bound to change at any moment.
:::

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

First, you'll want to clone the repo using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fleco-Development/fleco.git
```

## Config Setup

For the config, if you are working in the same directory, I would name the config either `test_config.yml` or `config.yml`, as these are both untracked by git. I would still strongly suggest putting the config file in another directory entirely to avoid uploading your secrets.\

The config template can be found below or in `config_tmpl.yml`

```yaml
token: <BOT_TOKEN>
database:
  host: 127.0.0.1
  user: <user>
  pass: <pwd>
  name: fleco
  port: 5432
```

## Database Setup

I have included a script to help setup the db first time for you. You can just run the command below:

```bash
npm run db:setup -- --config /path/to/config.yml
```

## Run the bot

Fleco is desgined to run on both [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) runtimes. So there is multiple ways to start the bot:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label="Node.JS">
	
		<Tabs>
			<TabItem label="npm">

				```bash
				npm start -- --config /path/to/config.yml
				```

			</TabItem>
			<TabItem label="pnpm">

				```bash
				pnpm start --config /path/to/config.yml
				```

			</TabItem>
		</Tabs>

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label="Bun">

		```bash
		bun run start:bun -- --config /path/to/config.yml
		```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>
